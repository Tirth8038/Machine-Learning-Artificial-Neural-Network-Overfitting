# Machine-Learning-Artificial-Neural-Network-Overfitting
To demonstrate, that an (artificial) neural network can overfit to training data

Artificial Neural Network has replaced the traditional machine learning techniques in solving problems such as Image Processing, Object Detection and Natural Language Processing. But, sometimes their greatest advantage becomes a potential weakness. Lack of control over the learning process of our model may lead to Overfitting.
